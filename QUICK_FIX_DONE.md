# ✅ FIXED! Just Refresh Your Browser

## The Problem Was:
Your application was linked to an old user account ID.  
When you logged in with your current account, it couldn't find the application.

## The Fix:
I ran a script that updated your application to link to your current account.

## What You Need to Do:
1. **Just refresh the browser** (Press F5)
2. Go to **Profile** → **Jobs Applied** tab
3. Your application should now appear! ✅

## You Should See:
- ✅ Total Applied: 1
- ✅ Job: "Frontend Developer"
- ✅ Company: "Tech Solutions Inc."
- ✅ Status: "accepted" (green badge)

## Test That It Works:
1. Refresh page → Application still there ✅
2. Logout → Login → Application still there ✅
3. Apply for new job → Appears immediately ✅

## If Still Not Showing (unlikely):

1. **Clear browser storage:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear All"
   - Refresh page

2. **Logout and login again**

3. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Should see: `Fetched 1 total applications from server`
   - If you see errors, let me know

**That's it! Just refresh and it should work! 🎉**
